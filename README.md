# Heya, glitchy here.

- My unique username is sk8k9, but i like the name glitchy. Plus it would fit with how my linux machine (barely) works.

- Rarely ever gets priorities done -_- <sup>why can't i do anything unless im forced to?</sup>

Honestly ill be suprised if i ever finish Initceptor, it's looking quite good but yeah, no, there's always the chance of me abandoning stuff.
